# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### Use State 
- To make a value change on browser we need to make it reactive.
- useState Hook is used 
- const [name, setFunction] = useState('default value')
- setFunction('new value')
- re-renders component
